#JavaScript gallery which can efficiently work with hundreds of photos.

**kGallery is a gallery written on JavaScript using jQuery library.**

Advantage of this gallery is ability to work stable with hundreds of pictures or with big pictures, without freezing brouser. This effect is achieved by retrieving the list of images from external source (JSON or XML) and downloading pictures gradually until slideshow is playing, not all in ones.


Nearest analog is dojox.image.Gallery (dojox.image.ThumbnailPicker+dojox.image.SlideShow), however kGallery do not need to download dozens of JavaScript files with megabytes of code of dojo library.

**kGallery includes kSlideshow and kThumbnailPicker componnents, which can used independently.**
